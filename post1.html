    <p>AI is not just a buzzword anymore. In classrooms across the world, teachers are now using AI tools to assess students' progress, generate real-time feedback, and differentiate instruction based on each student’s needs.</p>
    <p>From ChatGPT helping students draft essays to intelligent dashboards that flag students at risk, AI is empowering teachers to become more effective than ever before.</p>
    <p>In 2025, the most successful educators will be those who learn how to use AI as a teaching assistant, not a threat.</p>
